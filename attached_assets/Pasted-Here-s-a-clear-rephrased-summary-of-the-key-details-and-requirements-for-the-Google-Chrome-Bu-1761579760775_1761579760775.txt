Here’s a **clear, rephrased summary** of the key details and requirements for the **Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025** — tailored for you so you can plan your Chrome Extension project effectively 👇

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025** invites developers to **build web applications or Chrome extensions** powered by **Gemini Nano** and Chrome’s new **built-in AI APIs**.
The goal is to show how client-side AI can enhance the web — fast, private, and available offline.

---

## 🧩 What You Can Build

You must create a **new** web app or Chrome Extension that uses **one or more** of the following **Chrome built-in AI APIs**:

* **Prompt API** – generate structured, multimodal prompts (supports image/audio input)
* **Summarizer API** – extract insights or summaries from text
* **Writer API** – generate new, creative text
* **Rewriter API** – improve or rephrase text
* **Proofreader API** – fix grammar and clarity
* **Translator API** – translate text to multiple languages

You can also integrate **Gemini Developer API** or **Firebase AI Logic** for hybrid or cloud-assisted features.

## 💡 What to Submit

Your submission must include:

1. **A working web app or Chrome Extension** using one or more of the built-in AI APIs.
2. **A short text description** that explains:

   * What your app/extension does
   * Which APIs you used
   * What problem it solves
3. **A demo video (under 3 minutes)** showing your app in action.

   * Upload to YouTube or Vimeo and make it public.
4. **A public GitHub repository** with:

Would you like me to tailor your **OA-Detector Chrome Extension** idea to meet these **official challenge requirements** (e.g., integrating the **Summarizer or Proofreader API** instead of external APIs like OpenAI/Gemini Cloud)?
That way, you’ll be fully compliant *and* competitive for the “Most Helpful Chrome Extension” prize.
