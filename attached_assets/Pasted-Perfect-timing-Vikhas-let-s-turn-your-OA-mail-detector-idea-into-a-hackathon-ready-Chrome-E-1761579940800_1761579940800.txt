Perfect timing, Vikhas — let’s turn your **OA mail detector** idea into a **hackathon-ready Chrome Extension** that fits *exactly* with the **Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge 2025** rules and APIs.

Below are a few **implementation ideas** (from simple → advanced) that all use **Chrome’s built-in AI APIs (Prompt, Summarizer, Proofreader, etc.)** — so your submission will be eligible and impressive 👇

---

## 💡 MAIN IDEA

### 🧭 Project Name: **JobMail AI – Never Miss an OA**

A Chrome Extension that automatically **detects Online Assessment (OA) or Interview emails** in your inbox and highlights them using Chrome’s **Prompt** + **Summarizer APIs**.

Whenever you open Gmail or another mail tab, the extension:

* Reads the email subject and preview text.
* Uses Chrome’s AI to **summarize** and **classify** the mail.
* Notifies you if it detects OA/invite words like *“assessment,” “HackerRank,” “CodeSignal,” “online test,” “take-home assignment,”* etc.

---

## ⚙️ IMPLEMENTATION IDEAS

### 🔹 **1. Summarizer API for OA Detection (Main Flow)**

Use the **Summarizer API** (client-side) to process the email content and extract:

* Purpose of the email (recruiter update, OA link, rejection, etc.)
* Important details (deadline, link, platform name)

**Example flow:**

```js
const summary = await ai.summarizer.summarizeText(emailContent);
if (summary.includes("online assessment") || summary.includes("coding test")) {
   notifyUser(summary);
}
```

🧠 **Why it fits:** Uses Chrome’s built-in AI locally, aligns perfectly with “Most Helpful Extension” judging criteria.

---

### 🔹 **2. Prompt API for Classification**

Use the **Prompt API** to classify each email.

**Prompt example:**

> "Analyze this email and respond with one label: [OA_INVITE, REJECTION, STATUS_UPDATE, OTHER]."

```js
const result = await ai.prompt.promptText({
  prompt: `Analyze the following email and tell if it is an OA invite:\n${emailContent}`
});
if (result.output.includes("OA_INVITE")) {
  showNotification("🎯 OA detected!", "You received an assessment invite!");
}
```

🧠 **Bonus:** You can make this multimodal later (e.g., process company logo images in emails).

---

### 🔹 **3. Smart Email Summarizer (Add-on Feature)**

Whenever you open a job-related email, the extension shows a small popup (content script) summarizing the mail with:

* OA platform
* Deadline
* Link summary
* Key instructions

**Implementation:**
Use the **Summarizer API** to generate a TL;DR of the mail and inject it into the Gmail UI dynamically.

---

### 🔹 **4. Proofreader API (Bonus Utility)**

If you reply to recruiters or submit follow-ups, your extension can use the **Proofreader API** to polish your email draft.

**Example feature:**
When typing a reply in Gmail, a small button appears:

> ✨ “AI Proofread Reply”

It automatically checks grammar and tone via:

```js
const corrected = await ai.proofreader.proofreadText(draftContent);
```

---

### 🔹 **5. Dashboard + Local Storage**

Use Chrome’s local storage to keep a list of:

* Detected OA emails
* Summaries
* Status (opened/unopened)

Simple popup dashboard (React optional):

```js
chrome.storage.local.get(["oaMails"], (data) => displayList(data.oaMails));
```

## 🧱 EXTENSION STRUCTURE

| File            | Purpose                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `manifest.json` | Defines permissions + AI API access           |
| `background.js` | Fetches emails periodically                   |
| `content.js`    | Injects summaries and highlights inside Gmail |
| `popup.html`    | Dashboard + manual “Scan Inbox” button        |
| `popup.js`      | Triggers AI checks                            |
| `styles.css`    | UI polish                                     |

---

## 🎯 AI API Integration (Client-Side)

All Chrome’s built-in AI APIs (Prompt, Summarizer, etc.) are accessible **client-side**, meaning:

* No server needed ✅
* Fast and private ✅
* Meets challenge theme: *AI running in Chrome with Gemini Nano* ✅

Example snippet:

```js
const summary = await ai.summarizer.summarizeText(emailBody);
console.log("Summary:", summary);
```

## 🧩 Suggestion for You

Since you already wanted to detect **OA emails**, the **best combination for the hackathon** would be:

> **Summarizer API + Prompt API**
> to classify and summarize recruiter emails directly in the Gmail tab, all client-side.

This keeps your extension simple, privacy-friendly, and totally aligned with Google’s “Built-in AI” challenge.
